A hyper-realistic, close-up, low-angle shot of a sizzling Gourmet Double Cheeseburger. Charred beef patties, thick, melty cheddar cheese dripping, vibrant green lettuce, and a glossy brioche bun with sesame seeds. Focus is razor-sharp on the burger, with a shallow depth of field (bokeh). Dramatic, warm, golden directional lighting highlights the textures and smoke curling faintly from the meat. Resting on a dark slate surface. Background shows blurred, crispy golden fries and dipping sauces. Professional food photography, cinematic color grading, 8K resolution.
